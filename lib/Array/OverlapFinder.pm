=head1 DESCRIPTION

Assuming you have two ordered sequences of items that might or might not
overlap, where the first sequence contains "earlier" items and the second
contains possibly "later" items, the functions in this module can find the
overlapping items for you or remove them combining the two sequence into one:

 # condition A, no overlaps
 sequence1: 1 2 3 4 5 6
 sequence2:              8 9 10
 overlap  :
 combined : 1 2 3 4 5 6  8 9 10

 # condition B, overlaps
 sequence1: 1 2 3 4 5 6
 sequence2:       4 5 6 7 8 9
 overlap  :       4 5 6
 combined : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

 # condition C, overlaps
 sequence1: 1 2 3 4 5 6
 sequence2:       4 5
 overlap  : 4 5
 combined : 1 2 3 4 5 6

 # condition D, overlaps
 sequence1: 1 2 3 4 5 6
 sequence2:       4 5 6
 overlap  :       4 5 6
 combined : 1 2 3 4 5 6

 # condition E, overlaps (identical)
 sequence1: 1 2 3 4 5 6
 sequence2: 1 2 3 4 5 6
 overlap  : 1 2 3 4 5 6
 combined : 1 2 3 4 5 6

 # condition F, overlaps
 sequence1: 1 2 3 4 5 6
 sequence2: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 overlap  : 1 2 3 4 5 6
 combined : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

 # condition G1, overlaps in the middle of second sequence will be assumed as non-overlapping
 sequence1: 1 2 3 4 5 6
 sequence2:   2 3 4 x x 5 6
 overlap  :
 combined : 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 x x 5 6

 # condition G2, multiple overlaps will be assumed as non-overlapping
 sequence1: 1 2 3 4 5 6
 sequence2: 2 3 4 x x 5 6 y y
 overlap  :
 combined : 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4 x x 5 6 y y

The functions can accept more than two sequences to find/remove overlapping
items in.

Use-cases: forming a non-overlapping sequence of items from repeated downloads
of RSS feed or "recent" page.


=head1 FUNCTIONS

All functions are not exported by default, but exportable.

=head2 find_overlap

Usage:

 find_overlap([ \%opts , ] \@seq1, \@seq2, ...)

=head2 combine_overlap

Usage:

 combine_overlap([ \%opts , ] \@seq1, \@seq2, ...)


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Algorithm::Diff>

L<Text::OverlapFinder> has a similar name, but the two modules are not that
related.
